const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does a Kibale chimpanzee trekking permit cost?",
    a: "A standard chimpanzee trekking permit costs USD 250 per person and includes an hour with a habituated chimp community. A longer Chimpanzee Habituation Experience, spending a full day with researchers and rangers, costs USD 300 per person and is limited to a handful of guests. Biikuya Trails Uganda arranges permits as part of every itinerary.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does chimp trekking compare to gorilla trekking?",
    a: "Chimp trekking is shorter, less physically demanding, and considerably more affordable than gorilla trekking. Chimpanzees are also more mobile and vocal than gorillas, so encounters tend to be noisier and more energetic — swinging through the canopy rather than resting on the ground.",
  },
  {
    q: "What else is there to do around Kibale?",
    a: "Kibale sits near Fort Portal, in Uganda's crater-lake and tea-growing country. Most itineraries pair chimp trekking with a walk through the Bigodi Wetland, a visit to a working tea estate, or a day looking toward the Rwenzori foothills.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is the best time to trek chimpanzees in Kibale?",
    a: "Chimp trekking runs year-round. The dry seasons of June–September and December–February offer firmer forest trails, while April, May and November bring quieter trails and, in some years, discounted low-season permit rates.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get to Kibale National Park?",
    a: "Kibale is roughly 5–6 hours by road from Kampala or Entebbe, or about 45 minutes by scheduled light aircraft to Kasese airstrip, followed by a short transfer.",
