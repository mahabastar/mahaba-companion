        { q: "Is street food like the Rolex safe to eat?", a: "Generally yes from a busy, popular stand where turnover is high and food is cooked fresh in front of you — the same common-sense rules that apply to street food anywhere." },

        { q: "What's the difference between matoke and posho?", a: "Matoke is steamed and mashed green banana with a subtle, slightly savoury flavour; posho is a firmer maize porridge closer to polenta. Both are common starch bases and often served together." },
