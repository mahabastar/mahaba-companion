You'll upload a scan of your passport's bio page, a passport photo, and your yellow fever vaccination certificate, then pay by card. Apply at least two weeks before you travel; approval usually comes back within about three business days, but leaving a buffer avoids any last-minute stress.",

If you're also visiting Kenya or Rwanda on the same trip, the East Africa Tourist Visa (USD 100) covers multi-entry travel across all three countries for 90 days — genuinely better value the moment your itinerary crosses a second border.",

        { q: "Can I get a Uganda visa on arrival instead of applying online?", a: "It's technically possible at some points of entry, but strongly discouraged — online applications are processed faster, and arriving without a pre-approved visa risks delays or complications at immigration. Apply online before you fly." },
        { q: "Do children need their own visa?", a: "Yes — every traveller, regardless of age, needs their own visa application and, for the yellow fever requirement, their own vaccination certificate." },
        { q: "Is the East Africa Tourist Visa worth it if I'm only visiting Uganda?", a: "No — at USD 100 versus USD 50 for the single-entry Uganda visa, it only pays off if your trip also includes Kenya or Rwanda." },
        { q: "Can I extend my visa once I'm in Uganda?", a: "Extensions are possible through the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control in Kampala, though it's simpler to apply for the visa duration you actually need from the outset." },
