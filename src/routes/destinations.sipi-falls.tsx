const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Where are Sipi Falls?",
    a: "Sipi Falls sit on the western slopes of Mount Elgon in eastern Uganda, near the town of Kapchorwa — three cascading waterfalls that drop from the volcano's escarpment toward the Karamoja plains.",
  },
  {
    q: "How difficult is the Sipi Falls three-falls hike?",
    a: "A moderate 4–5 hour loop through coffee gardens, forest and villages, linking all three waterfalls. Suitable for most fitness levels with a local guide.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I try Arabica coffee at Sipi Falls?",
    a: "Yes. The volcanic slopes of Mount Elgon produce some of the world's finest Arabica. Half-day farm experiences let you hand-pick, pulp, roast and brew your own coffee with a local farmer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best time to visit Sipi Falls?",
    a: "December to March and June to August are the driest months — best for hiking and photography. Green-season showers (April–May, September–November) make the falls thunder at their fullest.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I combine Sipi Falls with the rest of a Uganda safari?",
    a: "Sipi is 6 hours east of Kampala via Jinja, and connects beautifully with white-water rafting on the Nile or a flight north to Kidepo Valley National Park.",
