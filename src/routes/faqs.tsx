Mobile data coverage is decent in towns and around most lodges, though remote parks like Kidepo have patchy signal.",

      faqs={[
        { q: "Is Uganda safe to visit?", a: "Yes. Uganda's national parks are well-managed and security is a priority around all major tourist routes. As with any destination, normal travel precautions apply, and we brief every guest on specifics for their itinerary." },
        { q: "Do I need a visa for Uganda?", a: "Yes, every visitor does. Apply online in advance — see our full Visa Guide for the single-entry versus East Africa Tourist Visa comparison." },
        { q: "Do I need any vaccinations?", a: "A yellow fever vaccination certificate is mandatory for entry. Malaria prophylaxis is strongly recommended and should be discussed with your doctor before travel." },
        { q: "What's the best time to visit Uganda?", a: "The dry seasons (June–September and December–February) offer the easiest trekking conditions, though Uganda is a year-round destination — see our Seasonal Safari Calendar for a month-by-month breakdown." },
        { q: "How much does a Uganda safari cost?", a: "It varies widely by trip length, number of gorilla permits, and accommodation style. Try our Safari Budget Calculator for a personalised estimate." },
        { q: "How much does a gorilla trekking permit cost?", a: "USD 800 per person for a standard one-hour trek. See our Gorilla Permit Guide for exactly what's included and how booking works." },
        { q: "What currency should I bring?", a: "US dollars (notes printed 2006 or later) for tips and larger payments, alongside some Ugandan Shillings for small everyday purchases." },
        { q: "Do I need to tip guides and rangers?", a: "Tipping is expected and forms a meaningful part of local income — we provide specific guidance on typical amounts as part of your itinerary." },
        { q: "Is the water safe to drink?", a: "Stick to bottled or filtered water throughout your trip; it's provided at all lodges and included in vehicle transfers." },
        { q: "Will I have phone and internet signal?", a: "Coverage is decent in towns and at most lodges, including many in national parks, but can be patchy or unavailable in remote areas like Kidepo Valley." },
        { q: "What should I pack?", a: "Neutral-coloured layers, sturdy hiking boots, and rain protection are the essentials — see our full Packing Guide, including one clothing rule that surprises most first-time visitors." },
        { q: "Can I combine Uganda with Rwanda or Kenya?", a: "Yes — the East Africa Tourist Visa (USD 100) covers multi-entry travel across Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda for 90 days, making a combined itinerary straightforward." },
        { q: "How do I get around Uganda?", a: "Most itineraries use a private vehicle and driver-guide throughout. Fly-in options connect major parks in under an hour where road transfers would otherwise take most of a day." },
        { q: "Is Uganda good for families?", a: "Yes, with some planning around gorilla trekking's 15+ age minimum — see our Family Safaris guide for what works well at different ages." },
