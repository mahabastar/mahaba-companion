const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Where can I go chimpanzee trekking in Uganda?",
    a: "Three main places: Kibale National Park, which holds the highest chimpanzee density in Africa; Kyambura Gorge in Queen Elizabeth National Park, nicknamed the 'Valley of Apes'; and Budongo Forest near Murchison Falls, one of the country's most established habituation sites.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a chimpanzee permit cost?",
    a: "A standard Kibale chimpanzee trekking permit costs USD 250 per person for a one-hour visit. The longer Chimpanzee Habituation Experience, which follows researchers for a half-day as a wild community is habituated to human presence, costs USD 250 as well but runs 4+ hours.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does chimpanzee trekking compare to gorilla trekking?",
    a: "Chimpanzees are more active and vocal than gorillas, so a trek can mean covering more ground as the group moves through the canopy. Permits are also far cheaper (USD 250 vs USD 800) and easier to obtain, making chimp trekking a popular complement to — or standalone alternative to — a gorilla trek.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which location should I choose?",
    a: "Kibale offers the highest odds of a sighting and the widest range of primates. Kyambura Gorge suits travellers already based in Queen Elizabeth National Park who want to add primates without a detour. Budongo pairs naturally with Murchison Falls and offers the longer Habituation Experience.",
