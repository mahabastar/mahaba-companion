It does not cover porters, accommodation, transport, or meals. Hiring a porter — usually USD 15–20 — is optional but genuinely worth it: it directly supports community income and takes the physical load off you on what can be a long, steep trek.",

          title: "How and when to book",
          body: "Permits are allocated by the Uganda Wildlife Authority and must be booked through a registered tour operator, not directly by individual travellers. For peak season — June through September and December through February — book as far ahead as possible; popular sectors like Rushaga can sell out four to six months in advance. Trek Wild Uganda secures permits as part of every gorilla itinerary.",

          title: "Uganda vs Rwanda: the cost difference",
          body: "A Rwanda gorilla permit costs USD 1,500 — nearly double Uganda's. The gorillas and the experience are broadly comparable; the difference mainly reflects Rwanda's positioning as a more premium, more accessible (shorter drive from Kigali) destination. Uganda's four trekking sectors also mean considerably more permit availability overall.",

          title: "Cancellation and rescheduling",
          body: "Gorilla permits are largely non-refundable close to your trek date, and rescheduling depends on availability rather than being guaranteed. Comprehensive travel insurance that specifically covers pre-paid permit costs is strongly recommended, given the size of this single expense.",
        },
        {
          title: "The Gorilla Habituation Experience",
          body: "For a longer, less crowded alternative, Rushaga sector in Bwindi offers the Habituation Experience at USD 1,500 per person — up to four hours with a gorilla family still being acclimated to human presence, in smaller groups than the standard one-hour trek. It's a genuinely different experience, not just a longer version of the same one.",

      faqs={[
        { q: "Is there a minimum age for gorilla trekking?", a: "Yes — 15 years old, strictly enforced, for the gorillas' health as much as visitor safety. There is no exception process in Uganda for younger trekkers." },
        { q: "Are there discounted permits at certain times of year?", a: "Uganda has occasionally offered discounted permits during the quieter April, May and November low season — availability and pricing change, so we confirm current rates when planning your trip." },
        { q: "What happens if we don't find the gorillas?", a: "Sighting rates in Uganda are very high given experienced trackers and radio-collared or regularly monitored families, but it's genuinely wildlife, not guaranteed. Permits are not refunded for an unsuccessful trek." },
        { q: "How fit do I need to be for gorilla trekking?", a: "Treks range from 1 to 8 hours round trip depending on where the family has moved that morning, over steep and often muddy terrain. A reasonable fitness level helps; porters are available for anyone who wants extra support." },
        { q: "Can I photograph the gorillas?", a: "Yes, but flash photography is prohibited to protect their eyes — low-light technique matters more than equipment given the dense forest canopy." },
