const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What makes Semuliki different from Uganda's other forest parks?",
    a: "Semuliki is a low-altitude extension of the Congo Basin rainforest — the only place in Uganda with this type of lowland forest ecosystem. It shares more bird and plant species with Central Africa than with the rest of the country, including several found nowhere else in East Africa.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the Sempaya hot springs?",
    a: "A pair of boiling geothermal springs — the 'male' spring reaches around 100°C and can boil an egg in minutes, while the nearby 'female' spring forms a wider pool. Both sit in a clearing reached by an easy guided walk from the park headquarters.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Semuliki good for birding?",
    a: "Yes — over 400 species have been recorded, more than 60 of them found nowhere else in Uganda, drawing serious birders specifically for Congo-basin species like the yellow-throated nicator and several hornbill species.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get to Semuliki?",
    a: "It's roughly a 5–6 hour drive from Kampala via Fort Portal, and is usually combined with Kibale, Queen Elizabeth or Rwenzori Mountains National Park on a western Uganda circuit rather than visited on its own.",
