const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Should I trek gorillas in Mgahinga or Bwindi?",
    a: "Mgahinga has a single habituated gorilla family, so it's best chosen when it fits your route — typically as an add-on to climbing one of the three volcanoes, or when Bwindi's permits for your dates are sold out. Bwindi offers far more permit availability across four sectors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I climb a volcano and trek gorillas on the same trip?",
    a: "Yes, and it's one of Mgahinga's signature draws — Mount Sabinyo's three-country summit hike (Uganda, Rwanda, DR Congo) or Mount Muhabura's steep day climb pair naturally with a gorilla or golden monkey trek on a different day.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are golden monkeys and can I see them here?",
    a: "Golden monkeys are an endangered primate found only in the Virunga volcanoes' bamboo zone. Mgahinga offers dedicated golden monkey trekking, a lower-cost, less strenuous alternative or complement to gorilla trekking.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get to Mgahinga?",
    a: "It's roughly a 9–10 hour drive from Kampala, or most visitors combine it with Bwindi and Lake Bunyonyi on a south-western circuit, driving the 2–3 hours between them rather than visiting Mgahinga in isolation.",
