            <p>
              Trek Wild Uganda was built on one simple idea: the best journeys come from
              people who actually know the land. Not a call centre in another time zone, not
              a brochure written at a desk — guides who have spent their working lives in
              these forests, on these roads and at these viewpoints, and who go home to
              them afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between our two founders sit twenty-four years of professional guiding across
              Uganda. Years of tracking gorillas in Bwindi before the mist lifts off the
              ridge, of reading which way a herd will move at Paraa, of knowing which lodge
              kitchen will still feed you at ten at night after a long transfer from Kidepo.
              That knowledge isn't something a company can buy in; it accumulates one trip
              at a time, one wrong turn at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also grew up with these places as neighbours rather than attractions. The
              forest edge at Bwindi is farmland and school runs as well as gorilla habitat.
              Ishasha is a fishing village before it is a lion sighting. Part of our job is
              to make sure you meet the country that way too — invited into it, not simply
              driven through it — and that the money you spend reaches the households whose
              cooperation keeps these parks standing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built this site the way we would want a trip planned: real information
              before a sales pitch. A wildlife guide you can search, a seasonal calendar
              that tells you honestly which month suits you, a budget calculator that gives
              you a number before you have to ask for one. Every photograph here was taken
              by us, on our own trips. By the time you speak to us, you already know roughly
              what you want — our work is to make it run beautifully.

                Most of the rangers, trackers and guides we work with grew up in villages on
                a park boundary. They read the terrain and the animals' habits from a
                lifetime spent alongside them, not from a training manual — which is why a
                tracker can tell you a gorilla family fed here two hours ago from a bent
                stem you would have walked straight past. It is also, practically, how
                tourism money reaches the households whose cooperation keeps these parks
                protected: wages, permit revenue-sharing, school fees, and craft and produce
                bought locally. Our Responsible Tourism Centre sets out the specifics.
