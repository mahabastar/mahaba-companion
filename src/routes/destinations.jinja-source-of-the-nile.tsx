const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How difficult is white water rafting on the Nile?",
    a: "The main commercial stretch runs Grade 3 to Grade 5, with operators scouting conditions daily and offering routes suited to first-timers as well as experienced rafters. No prior rafting experience is required — guides handle safety briefings and instruction on the day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Nile rafting safe?",
    a: "Yes. Jinja's rafting operators run to international safety standards, with safety kayakers accompanying every trip and decades of combined operating experience on this stretch of river. Flipping is part of the fun on the bigger rapids, and guides are trained to recover swimmers quickly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't want to raft the big rapids?",
    a: "Jinja offers flat-water kayaking, tubing, stand-up paddleboarding and gentle boat cruises to the source of the Nile for a calmer alternative — all on the same river, at a fraction of the intensity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What else is there to do in Jinja?",
    a: "Beyond rafting: a 44-metre bungee jump over the Nile, quad biking, horseback riding, and a boat trip out to the exact spot where the Nile leaves Lake Victoria — the historic 'source' identified by the explorer John Hanning Speke in 1862.",
  },
  {
    q: "How far is Jinja from Kampala?",
    a: "About 80km, roughly 1.5–2 hours by road — making it an easy add-on at the start or end of a longer Uganda itinerary rather than a destination requiring a flight.",
