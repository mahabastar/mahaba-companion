In traditional Buganda culture, coffee beans — chewed rather than brewed — played a ceremonial role in friendship and oath-taking rituals, a use that predates the coffee industry entirely and sets Uganda apart from origin stories built purely around Arabica and export farming.",

        { q: "What's the difference between Uganda's Robusta and Arabica?", a: "Robusta is native to Uganda's lower-altitude forests and has deep cultural roots; Arabica is grown at higher elevation on volcanic soil, chiefly around Mount Elgon and the Rwenzori foothills, and tends toward a milder flavour profile." },
        { q: "Can I buy coffee to take home?", a: "Yes — most farm visits and cooperatives sell roasted or green beans directly, and it's one of the most genuine souvenirs available." },
        { q: "Is a coffee tour worth adding to a wildlife-focused itinerary?", a: "It pairs naturally with Kibale or the crater lakes near Fort Portal, since you're passing directly through coffee country either way." },
