const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How long does it take to summit Margherita Peak?",
    a: "Most operators run 7–9 day expeditions to Margherita Peak (5,109m), Africa's third-highest summit, with a couple of extra days improving acclimatisation and your odds of a clear-weather summit attempt. Shorter 2–5 day low-altitude treks are also available for those who want the scenery without the technical climb.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need mountaineering experience?",
    a: "The final push to Margherita Peak involves glacier travel, fixed ropes and some scrambling — you don't need prior mountaineering experience, but a good level of fitness is essential. Lower routes and shorter treks require no technical skill at all.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the glaciers still there?",
    a: "Yes, though reduced. Climate change has shrunk the Rwenzori's glaciers significantly over the past century, and they continue to recede. They're still visible near the highest peaks today, but this is very much a 'see it while you can' landscape.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does a Rwenzori trek cost?",
    a: "Full Margherita Peak expeditions typically run from around USD 1,300–1,900 per person depending on route, group size and duration, plus a separate Uganda Wildlife Authority park entrance fee of USD 35 per day. Shorter, lower-altitude treks cost considerably less.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is the best time to trek the Rwenzori?",
    a: "June to August and December to February bring the driest, clearest conditions. The Rwenzori's high year-round rainfall means trails are muddy in any season — good gaiters and rain gear matter whenever you go.",
